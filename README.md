# Chain Quest dApp

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case with a Chain Quest dApp. It includes smart contracts, tests, and deployment scripts.

## Deployment

This dApp has been deployed on the Scroll network.

### Scroll Deployment

The Chain Quest dApp is now live on the Scroll network. Scroll is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining Ethereum's security.

To interact with the dApp on Scroll:
1. Connect your wallet to the Scroll network
2. Visit the deployed dApp at [insert-dapp-url-here]
3. Ensure you have some Scroll ETH for gas fees

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
